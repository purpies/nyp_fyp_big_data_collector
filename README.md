# Project Showcase of my Final Year Project in Nanyang Polytechnic. ( Big Data Collector )

### Description:
This project repo consists of 3 key tools which will be elaborated later:
  1. Web Scrapping Tool - A tool which utilizes Python revolving around libraries/tools such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
  2. An Address Mapper - Built with tkinter to randomize mapping of foreign address to Singapore address.
  3. A sample dashboard - Developed using python libraries.


## Web Scraping Tool
The web scraping tool utilizes Python Language & revolves around libraries/tools such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract useful data of a user's choice based on a html element's xpath. 
The purpose of this tool is to collect a large dataset which can be highly useful & beneficial for educational purposes such as teaching of students/adult learners how to develop a dashboard using Python. Furthermore, with rich real dataset (In this example, e-commerce platform - Shopee Data) which can be familiar to the consumers (students), it allows for the students to better understand the data they are working with and aspire innovations as to how to manipulate the data to derive insightful knowledge & business insights such as creating associations, finding trending products etc.

## Address Mapper
This tool has a simple purpose which is to map foreign addresses to addresses of Singapore context. This is simply to provide students with a more localized dataset to work on. Furthermore, this also serves as a plausible path to venture to generate more data especially for teaching & learning purposes.

## Sample Dashboard
This sample dashboard showcases the feasibiity of the data collected/manipulated using the above 2 tools which proves that the datasets collected are rich and that it can be used for effective dashboarding & analysi. Overall, this tools is deemed to be effective of a tool to be using to collect data for educational purposes.
